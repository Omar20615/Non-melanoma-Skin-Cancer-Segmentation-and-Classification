# Histopathological analysis
 
This project implements an image processing pipeline to analyze a dataset of 1500 images and their masks. It includes gamma correction for image enhancement, mask labeling, and one-hot encoding for segmentation tasks. A U-Net model is employed for image segmentation, followed by training a classification model on the segmented data.
